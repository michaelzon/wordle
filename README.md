# Wordle App

A fun and interactive Wordle-inspired app where you can guess five-letter words, track your progress, and challenge yourself to beat the game! This app is built with React and offers a seamless user experience, dynamic feedback, and an intuitive design.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Word Generation**: Random words are fetched via the Datamuse API to keep the game fresh every time.
- **Interactive Grid**: Visual feedback for correct letters (`correct`) and partially correct letters (`present`).
- **User-Friendly Modal**: Displays winning or losing states with playful and encouraging messages.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Smooth and responsive key-based inputs for a classic Wordle feel.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for valid words and notifies you if a guess is invalid.
- **Clean Design**: Minimalistic UI with clear instructions and accessible features.

---

## How to Play

1. Guess the **mystery word** in 5 tries.
2. Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
3. Feedback is provided after each guess:
    - **Green** tiles indicate correct letters in the correct position.
    - **Yellow** tiles indicate correct letters in the wrong position.
4. You win if you guess the word within 5 attempts. Otherwise, try again!
